<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Animal Testing</li><li>Volunteer Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioavailability and bioequivalence services evaluate how drugs are absorbed and utilized by the body. The market is divided into two primary types: animal testing and volunteer testing. Animal testing involves using non-human subjects to assess pharmacokinetics and toxicology, ensuring safety and efficacy before human trials. Volunteer testing, on the other hand, involves human participants to directly measure a drug's bioavailability and bioequivalence. Both approaches are crucial for regulatory approvals and ensuring therapeutic effectiveness and safety in pharmaceuticals.</p></p>
