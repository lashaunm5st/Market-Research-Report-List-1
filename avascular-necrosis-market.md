<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Avascular Necrosis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trauma Related Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</li><li>Non-Trauma Related Avascular Necrosis (AVN)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The avascular necrosis (AVN) market is categorized into two main types: trauma-related AVN and non-trauma-related AVN. Trauma-related AVN occurs following injuries, such as fractures or dislocations that disrupt blood supply to the bone. Non-trauma-related AVN arises from factors like chronic corticosteroid use, excessive alcohol consumption, or underlying medical conditions, which can compromise blood flow. Both types result in bone cell death, leading to joint pain and dysfunction, but differ in their causative factors and patient management approaches.</p></p>
