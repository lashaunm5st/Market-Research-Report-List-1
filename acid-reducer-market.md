<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acid Reducer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Histamine Antagonists</li><li>Proton Pump Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The acid reducer market primarily comprises two types: histamine antagonists and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Histamine antagonists, such as ranitidine and famotidine, work by blocking histamine receptors in the stomach, reducing acid production. Proton pump inhibitors, like omeprazole and esomeprazole, inhibit the proton pump responsible for acid secretion, offering more potent and longer-lasting relief. Both classes are essential for treating conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers, catering to diverse patient needs and preferences.</p></p>
